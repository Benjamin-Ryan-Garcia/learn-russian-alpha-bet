This is a website that I made that helps you learn the Russian alphabet. As a Russian language minor, one of the first things I had to learn was the cyrillic alphabet. It's actually one of the easier parts of learning the language, and it's very rewarding being able to read and write in Russian, even if you don't know many words yet.
